            <h2>Why does everyone want to know English?</h2>
            <p>Well, we can name several reasons.. Here they are:</p>
            <ul>

                    have more access to information than your non-English speaking peers.</li>
                <li><b>To Meet and Communicate with More People</b>: if you are able to speak English proficiently, you will people able to communicate with more people. Be it where you live, at work, online or wherever you go. Being able to speak multiple
                    languages often gives you more opportunities in life and work than just speaking one language.</li>
                <li><b>Travelling</b>: when travel to different countries, English is often the most common “bridge” language. Meaning that you could meet with people from five different countries at the same time and it is likely the only common language
                    between all five people is English. English is able to connect people from many different countries and cultures more so than other languages.</li>
                <li><b>For Current Job or to Get Better Work</b>: if you increase your English proficiency, you often will be able to get a new job, a better job or a promotion where you are working. Having English speaking clients is very attractive and
                    often a necessity for millions of businesses worldwide. You may even get a higher salary or paid more hourly for speaking English fluently.</li>
                <li><b>For School or University Studies</b>: any schools and universities around the world require that their students have a basic or even intermediate understanding of the English language. Many have required courses that are taught in English.</li>
                <li><b>Social Status</b>: In some countries, speaking English fluently is highly regarded and sought after. This means that there are not many people that do speak English well and when they do; they stand out. When you learn to speak English
                    fluently, you may find that other people think highly of you and your English speaking skills. People may think to come to you with questions about English, travel or may even want to know your secret of how you learned English so
                    well.
                </li>
                <li><b>Science, Medicine, Economics, Law, Engineering and Politics</b>: ften education, research and common industry vocabulary is in English for these important careers. If is often required that people who study or work in these industries
                    do research and learn about new and cutting edge ideas within in their industry in English. Many of the top industry publications and research is in English.</li>
